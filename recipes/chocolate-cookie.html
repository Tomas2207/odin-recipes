      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie
          sheets or line with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and
          white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk
          until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just
          blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon.
          Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets.
          Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges
          are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before
          transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
