          Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of
          very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish
          made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as
          ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may
          include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices,
          like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.The dish may
          be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
          Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and
          then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into
          single-serving square portions.
