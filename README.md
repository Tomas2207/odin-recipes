For the initial structure i completed the basic HTML boilerplate.
Then i started by adding the first recipe. I chose lasagna, as it was the example. I found the lasagna recipe in the page that was provided.
Didn't like the photo there, i searched one in google. Saved it in the images folder and used an anchor element to display it on the page.
I searched for a description in wikipedia about lasagna, i copied and pasted it inside a paragraph element.
After that i used an h2 element for both the ingredients and the steps title. I made the unordered and ordered list within them.
I added a "Back Home" link by using another anchor element that goes back to index.
Then i added two more recipes by using the same structure as the lasagna page and making changes where needed.
Finally to make the home/index page less boring i added a cat eating noodles.
